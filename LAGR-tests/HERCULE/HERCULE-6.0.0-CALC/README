Single phase calculation
-> HERCULE-MONO

Two-phase calculations
For the first two-phase calculation: "standard" model, starting from the first Lagrangian step (MODCPL=0)
-> HERCULE-DIPH-STD
For the second two-phase calculation : "complete" model, starting from the first Lagrangian step (MODCPL=1 and IDIRLA=3)
-> HERCULE-DIPH-CPL

Remarks: The "complete" model diverges after some iterations due to a CFL number > 4. The time step were reduced from 0.001s to 0.0005s. So we add a periodicity for the 
lagrangian particle injection to keep the same number of particles. The calculation becomes stable but the flow structure is very different. The oscillation is stronger
 than with the "standard" model. It could be intersting to use the same time step (0.0005s) for the "standard" model and the single phase calculation.

For the three cases, we did only the time average for the radial and axial velocity. All the profiles were added in the GUI.
I think it is better to evaluate the convergence with the non-time average value at the probes.
