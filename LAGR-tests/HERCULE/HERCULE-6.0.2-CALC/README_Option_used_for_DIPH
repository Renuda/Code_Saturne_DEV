Contrary to the calculation of CS 1.1.1, the two-phase calculation with the "standard" model here runs with the first order for the integration for the stochastic differential equations (with CS 1.1.1 it was the second order). The second order crashes with CS 6.0.2 after few iterations. And for the "complete" model, the first order for the integration for the stochastic differential equations was used for the same reason than for the "standard" model and it was necessary to uncheck the particle turbulent dispersion option.
