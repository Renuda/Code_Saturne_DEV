In this setup we change the time step in the MONO calculation from 10-4 to 10-5 at t=0.5s to avoid the jump at the lagrangian restart calculation.

Remarks : Think to update the line 62 "start_average = "in lag_script_tab_1inj_For_CS62alpha.py to put exactly the time of the last iteration of the MONO calculation to create the selectivity curve if the user want to change some parameters about the time.
